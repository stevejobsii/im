1. Replace :is-show.sync="empty" with :is-show="empty", then $emit an event from the child component to trigger an update to empty in the parent

5. Replace filtered value in v-html="commodity.event_base_info | rnTransform" with a method or computed property
  Line 45: /Users/zhudi/Code/php/im/resources/assets/js/event/components/Commodity/CommodityDetail.vue

  Reason: Directives have been vastly reduced in scope and components are preferred in most use cases
